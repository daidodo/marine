# Marine Library

**Marine** is a C++ library for Linux Networking Development. It is refined from real-world projects
and systems, with plenty of advantages and practical considerations proven to be successful. It is
required to be **simple** and **elegant**, with little efforts to understand and maintain, thus
could be a reliable basis for complex systems.

**Marine** is a pure C++ headers library, which means you don't need to link any `.a` or `.so`, and
avoid many subtle problems among different environments. It is targeted to Linux with POSIX support,
which is the mainstream of back-end systems. There is no intent to compromise it to Windows or Mac
OS because that would incur significant complexity of implementation.
